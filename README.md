My younger brother asked me if it's possible to download all the pokemon sound files from a page at once. So I made this tool for him. To use it provide URL and choos media type to download. It's not perfect but it does the job.

Page hosted on Vercel https://bulk-downloader-beta.vercel.app/

## To run it locally

First install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build:

```bash
npm run build
```

to start production server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## TODO

- add progress bar
- add AbortController to cancel fetch
